Changelog

## 2.0.0-a1
* Test release

## 2.0.0-b01
* Test release

## 2.0.0
* Release 2.0.0

## 2.1.0
* Update Azure Service Bus dependency to 3.4.0

## 2.2.0
* Allow `/` in queue and topic names

## 3.0.0
* Update to Rebus 3

## 4.0.0
* Update to Rebus 4
* Update to new project structure (.NET Core unfortunately not support by the driver at this time)

## 4.0.1
* Add .NET Standard 2.0 target specifically to handle dependency on `ConfigurationManager`
* `.ConfigureAwait(false)` everywhere something is `await`ed - thanks [lezzi]

## 5.0.0
* Remove ability to run on the "Basic" tier because it makes the world simpler, and you should at least be using "Standard" anyway
* Add ability to set actual message ID on the `BrokeredMessage` by using Rebus' message ID as the value

## 5.0.1
* Fix handling of connection string when it contains the `EntityPath` element. Makes it possible to use a connection string with only RECEIVE rights to the input queue

## 6.0.0
* Update to Microsoft's new driver and thus gain .NET Core support - finally!
* Add ability configure (and re-configure if possible) these queue settings: partitioning, peek lock duration, default message TTL

## 6.0.1
* Port aforementioned (v. 5.0.1) `EntityPath` handling forward

## 6.0.3
* Fix bug that would result in `MessagingEntityNotFoundException`s when publishing to non-existent topics

## 6.0.4
* Small improvement of subscription registration performance by avoiding an update if the subscription looks as it should

## 6.0.5
* Fix bug that would "forget" to stop automatic peek lock renewal in cases where message handler throws an exception, generating unnecessary noise in the log

## 6.0.6
* Update Azure Service Bus dependency to 3.2.1

## 6.0.7
* Fix bug that would result in always require a manage permission in the shared access policy, even if the queues were already created - thanks [ehabelgindy]

## 7.0.0
* Several adjustments to how queue names are validated and how topic names are generated. Please note that this is a BREAKING CHANGE, because queue names and topic names are no longer automatically lowercased (because it's not necessary), and topic names can now have . in them (because that has always been possible). If you update to 7, you must update ALL of your endpoints, otherwise pub/sub will not work!
* Fix bug that would "forget" to stop automatic peek lock renewal in cases where message handler throws an exception, generating unnecessary noise in the log
* Add ability to run in "legacy naming mode", meaning that topics are more conservatively sanitized to work the same way as all versions of the transport prior to version 7
* Fix bug that accidentally replaced `/` in topic names when publishing, which would cause topics with `/` to be unreachable
* Fix one-way client legacy naming bug (one-way client would not adhere to legacy naming convention, even when `.UseLegacyNaming()` was called on the configuration builder)
* Default to using topics nested beneath their assemblies, so e.g. `await bus.Subscribe<string>()` will result in the creation of a topic named `mscorlib/System.String`, which will be formatted as a topic named `System.String` nested beneath `mscorlib` in tools that support it
* Pluggable naming strategy via `INameFormatter`, allowing for customizing all aspects of how e.g. .NET types are named when creating topics from them, how queue names are normalized/sanitized, etc. - thanks [jr01]
* Added transport setting for overriding the Receive OperationTimeout - thanks [jr01]
* Update Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus to version 4.1.1 to avoid reconnection bug described here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-dotnet/issues/639
* Change it so that topics are initialized by both subscribers and publishers, the philosophy being: If someone subscribes/publishes to it, it must mean that it exists and thus should have an ASB entity representing it
* Ensure that the sequence of operations is bulletproof when renewing peek locks - thanks [jr01]
* Change topic and subscription creation to be more defensive to avoid exceptions as part of normal program flow
* Fix potential deadlock in initialization of topic clients - thanks [jr01]
* Fix bug that prevented one-way clients from deferring messages
* Update to Rebus 6

## 7.1.0
* Add ability to authenticate by prioviding an `ITokenProvider`, enabling much more fine-grained access control - thanks [eeskildsen]

## 7.1.1
* Fix bug that would make the transport unable to receive a message with a NULL value present in the headers dictionary

## 7.1.2
* Make peek lock renewal more robust and less resource-intensive

## 7.1.3
* Update Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus dependency to 4.1.2

## 7.1.4
* Use transport type from connection string - thanks [benne]

## 7.1.5
* Fix bug that would cause deferred messages to be sent to the wrong queue in cases where a custom queue naming convention was used that would somehow mess with the magic deferred messages queue name

## 7.1.6
* Actually fix bug described in previous entry

## 8.0.0
* Update Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus dependency to 5.1.0
* Update Microsoft.Identity.Client dependency to 4.22.0

## 8.0.1
* Fix bug that would result in inability to dead-letter a deferred message

## 8.1.0
* Add ability to use native dead-lettering by calling `t => t.UseNativeDeadlettering()` on the transport configurer. The basic of this functionality is the addition of `Message` and `MessageReceiver` to the transaction context, which makes it possible for user code to take over the responsibility for ACK/NACK/Dead-lettering the message

## 8.1.1
* Trim dead letter reason/description to not exceed 4096 characters, which is the maximum length of an ASB header value

## 8.1.5
* Add intelligent batching to send logic, ensuring that request payload stays below 256 kB (and make it configurable!)

## 9.0.0
* Port to new Azure Service Bus driver (Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus) - thanks [binick]
* Use the new driver's built-in ability to create message batches

## 9.0.5
* Update Azure Service Bus driver

## 9.0.6
* Fix bug that would result in creating massive amounts of topic client message senders, which would never be disposed

## 9.0.7
* Log it when using Azure Service Bus' built-in dead-lettering on a message - thanks [hjalle]

## 9.0.8
* Update Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus dependency to 7.5.1

## 9.1.0
* Enable the use of sessions - thanks [georgechond94]
* Update Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus dependency to 7.10.0
* Update azure.identity dependency to 1.7.0
* Update Rebus dependency to 6.6.5

## 9.2.0
* Remove broken session support
* Remove potential race condition that came with session support

## 9.3.0
* Include the headers of the transport message when NACKing or natively dead-lettering the message, thus providing the ability to mutate them for each delivery attempt - thanks [jorgenbosman]

## 9.3.1
* Don't pass shutdown cancellation token when ACK/NACKing to avoid cancelling the call immediately when shutting down

## 9.3.2
* Avoid logging failed peek lock renewal attempts when there's a race between renewal and ACK/NACK by detecting if the message has been removed from the list of messages to automatically renew

## 9.3.3
* Additional cancellation tweaks: Proceed with sending outgoing messages even during shutdown, because the user's code must have finished executing without errors, and therefore we should try to complete the message transaction to make for the least surprising outcome

## 9.3.4
* Fix bug that would cause the transport to lose the TransportType part of its connection string, thus making it impossible to configure it to use AmqpWebSockets

## 9.3.5
* Move removal of message ID from list of message lock renewers to the beginning of OnCompleted, so it will be executed first thing and will not be affected by failures during ACK
* Update Azure.Identity dep to 1.8.2

## 10.0.0
* Update to Rebus 8

## 10.1.0
* Update to Rebus 8.2.0 and Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus 7.17.2
* Add ability to provide native message delivery count in optional Rebus header

## 10.1.1
* Fix bug that would accidentally leave a `SessionId` header on messages sent to the error queue, even though there was no session ID on the ASB message

## 10.2.0
* Update Azure.Identity dependency to 1.11.0
* Update Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus dependency to 7.17.5
* Update Rebus dependency to 8.4.2

## 10.3.0
* Update Azure.Identity dependency to 1.13.2
* Update Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus dependency to 7.18.4

## 10.4.0
* Add ability to "leave the topics alone" to enable running with less privileges - thanks [RenanZanelato]
